# Automatasaurus

An automated software development workflow powered by Claude Code. Uses specialized subagents, stop hooks, and skills to enable extended autonomous development sessions with multiple coordinated personas.

## Quick Start

Get automatasaurus running in your project in under a minute:

```bash
# Prerequisites: Claude Code CLI and GitHub CLI must be installed
# Install: https://claude.ai/code and https://cli.github.com/

# Initialize in your project
cd your-project
npx automatasaurus init

# Start Claude Code
claude

# Begin discovery for a new feature
/discovery user authentication system

# Or work through existing issues
/work-all
```

That's it! The framework installs agents, skills, hooks, and slash commands into your project. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for detailed setup instructions.

## Overview

Automatasaurus creates a team of AI personas that work together through GitHub issues and PRs to build software. Each persona has specific expertise and responsibilities, and they coordinate their work using established software development practices.

**This repository contains the workflow orchestration framework.** Install it into your project to enable AI-assisted software development with coordinated agents.

## Workflow

The workflow operates in two phases:

### Phase 1: Discovery (Interactive)

```
User describes feature/project
    ↓
Product Manager: Leads discovery conversation
  - Goals and success metrics
  - Users and stakeholders
  - Business logic and constraints
  - Infrastructure requirements
    ↓
PM brings in specialists as needed:
  - Architect: Technical feasibility, patterns
  - Product Owner: User stories, acceptance criteria
  - UI/UX: Design requirements
    ↓
Product Owner: Creates GitHub issues with:
  - User stories and acceptance criteria
  - Dependencies ("Depends on #X")
  - Organized into milestones
    ↓
User approves milestone/issue breakdown
    ↓
User: "Start working on the issues"
```

### Phase 2: Autonomous Loop (PM Coordinated)

```

```

**Note:** Files in `.automatasaurus/` are managed by the installer and updated via `npx automatasaurus update`. Add your own custom agents/skills directly to `.claude/` (not as symlinks).

## Installation

```bash
# Initialize automatasaurus in your project
cd your-project
npx automatasaurus init
```

This will:
1. Copy framework files to `.automatasaurus/` directory
2. Create symlinks in `.claude/` pointing to framework files
3. Merge automatasaurus config into `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/settings.json`
4. Set up slash commands, agents, skills, and hooks

After initialization:
1. Customize `.claude/commands.md` with your project's build/test commands
2. Ensure GitHub CLI is authenticated: `gh auth status`
3. Start Claude Code: `claude`

### CLI Commands

```bash
npx automatasaurus init      # Install into current project
npx automatasaurus update    # Update framework files to latest
npx automatasaurus status    # Show installation info
```

## Usage

### Slash Commands

The primary way to invoke workflows:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/discovery [feature]` | Start discovery to understand requirements and create plan |
| `/work-all` | Work through all open issues autonomously |
| `/work [issue#]` | Work on a specific issue |

### `/discovery` - Discovery Mode

```
/discovery user authentication system
```

The Product Manager will:
- Lead a discovery conversation about goals, constraints, and requirements
- Bring in specialists (Architect, Product Owner, UI/UX) as topics arise
- Work with Product Owner to create well-formed GitHub issues
- Organize issues into milestones
- Get your approval before any implementation

### `/work-all` - Autonomous Loop

```
/work-all
```

The PM will:
- List all remaining issues
- Select next issue based on dependencies and priority
- Coordinate the full workflow (Developer → Reviews → Tester → Merge)
- Continue until all issues complete or blocked on human input

### `/work` - Single Issue

```
/work 42
```

Works on just issue #42:
- Checks dependencies are satisfied
- Routes through the full workflow
- Stops after that issue is merged

### Invoking Specific Agents

You can also invoke agents directly:

```
Use the architect agent to review the database schema
Use the tester agent to create a test plan for the API
Use the tester agent with playwright to verify the checkout flow
```

## Dependency Tracking

Issues track dependencies in their body:

```markdown
## Dependencies
Depends on #12 (User authentication)
Depends on #15 (Database schema)
```

The PM uses this to determine issue order - an issue is only "ready" when all dependencies are closed.

## State Labels

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ready` | No blocking dependencies, can be worked |
| `in-progress` | Currently being implemented |
| `blocked` | Waiting on dependencies or input |
| `needs-review` | PR open, awaiting reviews |
| `needs-testing` | Reviews complete, awaiting tester |
| `priority:high/medium/low` | Work order priority |

## Escalation Flow

When the Developer gets stuck after 5 attempts:

```
Developer stuck
    ↓
Escalate to Architect
    ↓
Architect analyzes and provides guidance
    ↓
If Architect also stuck → Notify human and wait
```

## Notifications

Agents send desktop notifications when they need your attention:

| Type | Trigger | Sound |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Question** | Agent has a blocking question | Submarine |
| **Approval** | PR or decision needs approval | Submarine |
| **Stuck** | Agent encountered an issue | Basso |
| **Complete** | All work finished | Hero |

## Configuration

### Project Commands

Edit `.claude/commands.md` for your project's commands:

```markdown
## Quick Reference

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Install dependencies | `npm install` |
| Start development server | `npm run dev` |
| Run all tests | `npm test` |
| Run E2E tests | `npx playwright test` |
```

### MCP Servers

The `.mcp.json` file configures Playwright for browser testing:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Notifications

Configure notification behavior via environment variables:

```bash
# Disable sound alerts
export AUTOMATASAURUS_SOUND=false

# Custom log location
export AUTOMATASAURUS_LOG=/path/to/log
```

## Language Skills

The developer agent loads language-specific skills on demand:

| Language | Skill | Covers |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Python | `python-standards` | PEP 8, type hints, pytest, async patterns |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | `javascript-standards` | ESM, React, testing, error handling |
| CSS/SCSS | `css-standards` | BEM, CSS variables, flexbox/grid, accessibility |

## Customization

### Adding a New Persona

1. Create `.claude/agents/<persona-name>/AGENT.md`
2. Define the frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: persona-name
   description: When to use this agent
   tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob
   model: sonnet
   ---
   ```
3. Write a detailed system prompt including:
   - Responsibilities
   - When to use this agent
   - Comment format: `**[Agent Name]** comment text`
4. Update `CLAUDE.md` with the new persona

### Creating Skills

1. Create `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. Add frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: What this skill does and when to use it
   ---
   ```
3. Document the workflow or knowledge
4. Skills are loaded on-demand when relevant
