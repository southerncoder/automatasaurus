## Summary
Move deterministic orchestration logic (dependency checking, priority sorting, review parsing) from AI-interpreted markdown to explicit code, while keeping AI focused on creative work (implementation, reviews, design).

## Current State
- Main branch: AI interprets markdown command files to orchestrate workflow
- copilot-v0: JavaScript orchestration with AI for implementation

## Problem
- AI orchestration is less predictable and harder to debug
- Deterministic tasks (parsing markers, checking dependencies) don't benefit from AI
- Workflow reliability depends on AI interpretation consistency

## Proposed Solution
Port main branch to CLI-based orchestration similar to copilot-v0:
1. Move dependency checking to JavaScript
2. Move priority sorting to JavaScript  
3. Move review status parsing to JavaScript
4. Keep AI agents for: discovery conversations, code implementation, PR reviews, testing

## Benefits
- More predictable and debuggable workflow
- Faster execution (no AI for simple logic)
- Easier to test and maintain
- AI focuses on high-value creative tasks

### Example Implementation Snippets

```javascript
// Issue selection in CLI
const openIssues = await listOpenIssues();
const ordered = openIssues.sort(byPriority).filter(isReadyToWork);
// ... loop through efficiently ...
```

```javascript
// Explicit dependency check
const deps = parseDependencies(issue.body);
for (const dep of deps) {
  // Check if closed via GitHub API
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Core orchestration logic moved to src/commands/
- [ ] Dependency checking implemented in code
- [ ] Review marker parsing implemented in code
- [ ] Priority sorting implemented in code
- [ ] AI agents only called for creative tasks
- [ ] Tests for orchestration logic
- [ ] Documentation updated
