# Plan - Requirements Gathering Mode

Start a planning session to gather requirements and create GitHub issues.

## Instructions

You are now entering **Planning Mode**. Use the Product Owner agent to gather requirements.

### Your Process

1. **Engage as Product Owner** - Load the product-owner agent persona

2. **Ask clarifying questions** - Be thorough and inquisitive:
   - Who are the users?
   - What's the complete user flow?
   - What data is involved? Validation rules?
   - What are the edge cases and error scenarios?
   - What's in scope vs out of scope?
   - Security/permission requirements?

3. **Don't assume** - If something is unclear, ask. The more we nail down upfront, the better the results.

4. **Work with Architect** - Once requirements are clear, consult the Architect for:
   - Technical feasibility
   - Technology choices
   - Architecture decisions (document in ADRs if significant)

5. **Create GitHub issues** - Break down into issues sized for single PRs:
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Dependencies documented ("Depends on #X")
   - Priority labels applied
   - Out of scope explicitly stated

6. **Get approval** - Present the issue breakdown to the user for approval before any implementation begins.
