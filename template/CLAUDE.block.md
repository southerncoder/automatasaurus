# Automatasaurus - Claude Code Automation Framework

This project uses Automatasaurus, an automated software development workflow powered by Claude Code. It uses specialized subagents, stop hooks, and skills to coordinate work across multiple personas.

## Workflow

### Two-Phase Operation

**Phase 1: Planning (Interactive)**
- Product Owner gathers requirements from user
- Architect makes technology decisions
- Product Owner creates GitHub issues with dependencies
- User approves before autonomous work begins

**Phase 2: Autonomous Loop (PM Coordinated)**
- PM selects next issue based on dependencies and priority
- Routes to specialists (UI/UX if needed)
- Developer implements and opens PR
- Review cycle: Architect (required), SecOps/UI-UX (optional)
- Tester does final verification and merges
- Loop continues until all issues complete

### Escalation Flow

When stuck:
1. Developer tries up to 5 times
2. Escalates to Architect for analysis
3. If Architect also stuck - Notify human and wait

## Project Commands

**IMPORTANT**: Always check `.claude/commands.md` for project-specific commands before running any development, test, or build commands. Each target project will have its own commands configured.

Common command categories:
- `install` - Install dependencies
- `dev` - Start development server
- `test` - Run tests
- `test:e2e` - Run E2E tests with Playwright
- `build` - Build for production
- `lint` - Check code style

## Personas/Agents

The following agents are available in `.claude/agents/`:

| Agent | Role | Model | Review Status |
|-------|------|-------|---------------|
| `product-owner` | Requirements, issues, follow-ups | Opus | N/A |
| `product-manager` | Workflow coordinator, drives the loop | Sonnet | N/A |
| `architect` | Design, ADRs, stuck-issue analysis | Opus | **Required** |
| `developer` | Implementation, PRs, addressing feedback | Sonnet | N/A |
| `tester` | QA, Playwright, final merge authority | Sonnet | N/A |
| `secops` | Security reviews | Opus | Optional (can decline) |
| `ui-ux` | Design specs, accessibility | Sonnet | Optional (can decline) |

## Agent Comment Format

**All agents MUST prefix their comments with their identity:**

```markdown
**[PM]** Starting work on issue #5. Routing to Developer.
**[Developer]** Fixed in commit abc1234. Ready for re-review.
**[Architect]** LGTM. Clean separation of concerns.
**[SecOps]** N/A - No security impact in this change.
**[UI/UX]** N/A - No UI changes in this PR.
**[Tester]** Verified and approved. Merging.
**[Product Owner]** Created follow-up issue #12 for discovered scope.
```

## State Labels

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ready` | No blocking dependencies, can be worked |
| `in-progress` | Currently being implemented |
| `blocked` | Waiting on dependencies or input |
| `needs-review` | PR open, awaiting reviews |
| `needs-testing` | Reviews complete, awaiting tester |
| `priority:high/medium/low` | Work order priority |

## Dependency Tracking

Issues document dependencies in their body:

```markdown
## Dependencies
Depends on #12 (User authentication)
Depends on #15 (Database schema)
```

PM parses these to determine issue order.

## MCP Integrations

### Playwright MCP
The tester agent has access to Playwright MCP for browser-based testing:
- Visual verification of UI changes
- E2E user flow testing
- Screenshot capture
- Interactive debugging

Usage: `Use playwright mcp to open a browser to [URL]`

## Stop Hook Behavior

The system uses intelligent stop hooks to ensure:
1. Tasks are fully completed before stopping
2. Open issues checked for more work
3. PRs reviewed and merged
4. Proper agent handoffs
5. Notifications sent when stuck or complete

## Development Conventions

### Git Workflow
- Branch naming: `{issue-num}-{slug}` (e.g., `42-user-authentication`)
- Commit frequently at logical checkpoints
- Commit format: `type: description (#issue)`
- PR body must include: `Closes #{issue-number}`
- PRs require Architect approval before merge
- Tester performs final verification and merge

### Code Style
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write tests for new functionality
- Handle errors appropriately

### Documentation
- Update README for user-facing changes
- Create ADRs for significant architectural decisions
- Document APIs and complex logic

## Slash Commands

Primary way to invoke workflows:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/plan [feature]` | Start requirements gathering and planning |
| `/work-all` | Work through all open issues autonomously |
| `/work [issue#]` | Work on a specific issue |

Examples:
```
/plan user authentication system
/work-all
/work 42
```

## Agent Invocation

Agents can also be invoked explicitly:
```
Use the architect agent to design the authentication system
Use the secops agent to review this PR for security issues
Use the tester agent to create a test plan for this feature
Use the tester agent with playwright to verify the login flow
```

Or they are automatically selected based on task context.

## GitHub Integration

This project uses the `gh` CLI for GitHub operations. Ensure you are authenticated:
```bash
gh auth status
```

## Skills

Available skills in `.claude/skills/`:

### Workflow Skills
- `workflow-orchestration` - Full workflow loop documentation
- `github-workflow` - Issue/PR management, state labels
- `pr-writing` - Best practices for writing clear PR descriptions
- `code-review` - Best practices for performing thorough code reviews
- `agent-coordination` - Multi-agent workflow patterns
- `project-commands` - Finding and using project-specific commands
- `notifications` - User notification system for questions, approvals, and alerts

### Language Standards
- `python-standards` - Python coding conventions, typing, testing patterns
- `javascript-standards` - JS/TS conventions, React patterns, testing
- `css-standards` - CSS/SCSS conventions, layouts, accessibility

**Note**: Load the appropriate language skill before writing code in that language.

## Notification System

Agents can alert the user when attention is needed:

```bash
# Question that blocks progress
.claude/hooks/request-attention.sh question "Which approach should I take?"

# Approval needed
.claude/hooks/request-attention.sh approval "PR is ready for review"

# Got stuck
.claude/hooks/request-attention.sh stuck "Cannot resolve this error"

# Work complete
.claude/hooks/request-attention.sh complete "All tasks finished"
```

Notifications are also sent automatically on stop based on context.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `WORKFLOW_MODE` | Set to "automated" for autonomous operation |
| `GITHUB_WORKFLOW` | Set to "enabled" for GitHub integration |
| `AUTOMATASAURUS_SOUND` | Set to "false" to disable notification sounds |
| `AUTOMATASAURUS_LOG` | Custom log file location |
| `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` | Number of attempts before escalation (default: 5) |
