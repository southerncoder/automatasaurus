# Automatasaurus

<img src="logo.jpeg" alt="Automatasaurus Logo" width="200">

An automated software development workflow powered by Claude Code. Uses specialized subagents, stop hooks, and skills to enable extended autonomous development sessions with multiple coordinated agents.

## Quick Start

Get automatasaurus running in your project in under a minute:

```bash
# Prerequisites: Claude Code CLI and GitHub CLI must be installed
# Install: https://claude.ai/code and https://cli.github.com/

# Initialize in your project
cd your-project
npx automatasaurus init

# Start Claude Code
claude

# Begin discovery for a new feature
/discovery user authentication system

# Review and sequence the implementation plan
/work-plan

# Work through all issues autonomously
/work-all
```

That's it! The framework installs agents, skills, hooks, and slash commands into your project. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for detailed setup instructions.

## Overview

Automatasaurus creates a team of AI agents that work together through GitHub issues and PRs to build software. Each agent has specific expertise and responsibilities, and they coordinate their work using established software development practices.

**This repository contains the workflow orchestration framework.** Install it into your project to enable AI-assisted software development with coordinated agents.

## Workflow

The workflow operates in two phases:

### Phase 1: Discovery (Interactive)

```
User: /discovery "feature description"
    ↓
Discovery command facilitates conversation:
  - Goals and success metrics
  - Users and stakeholders
  - Business logic and constraints
  - Infrastructure requirements
    ↓
Brings in specialists for review:
  - Architect: Technical feasibility
  - Designer: UI/UX considerations
    ↓
Creates GitHub issues with:
  - User stories and acceptance criteria
  - Dependencies ("Depends on #X")
  - Organized into milestones
    ↓
User approves milestone/issue breakdown
    ↓
User: /work-plan (analyze dependencies, create sequence)
    ↓
User: /work-all
```

### Phase 2: Autonomous Loop (Command Orchestrated)

```

## Project Structure

After running `npx automatasaurus init`, your project will have:

```

    ├── skills/ → .automatasaurus/skills/
    ├── hooks/ → .automatasaurus/hooks/

```

**Note:** Files in `.automatasaurus/` are managed by the installer and updated via `npx automatasaurus update`. Add your own custom agents/skills directly to `.claude/` (not as symlinks).

## Installation

### From npm (recommended)

```bash
# Initialize automatasaurus in your project
cd your-project
npx automatasaurus init
```

### From local build

To install from a local checkout (useful for testing changes before publishing):

```bash
# 1. In the automatasaurus repo, create the package tarball
cd ~/src/automatasaurus
npm pack
# Creates automatasaurus-0.1.0.tgz (version number from package.json)

# 2. In your target project, install the tarball
cd ~/src/your-project
npm install ~/src/automatasaurus/automatasaurus-0.1.0.tgz

# 3. Run the init command
npx automatasaurus init
```

**Note:** Use `npm install` (not `npx install`) to add the package, then `npx automatasaurus` to run the CLI.

This approach tests exactly what would be published to npm, catching any packaging issues like missing files.

### Updating from local build

When testing changes to automatasaurus, you need to reinstall the tarball before running update:

```bash
# 1. In the automatasaurus repo, create a new tarball
cd ~/src/automatasaurus
npm pack

# 2. In your target project, reinstall and update
cd ~/src/your-project
npm install ~/src/automatasaurus/automatasaurus-0.1.0.tgz
npx automatasaurus update --force
```

The `--force` flag is needed because the version number may not have changed. Without it, update will say "Already at latest version."

**Alternative:** Run directly from source without packing:
```bash
npx ~/src/automatasaurus update --force
```

### What init does

This will:
1. Copy framework files to `.automatasaurus/` directory
2. Create symlinks in `.claude/` pointing to framework files
3. Merge automatasaurus config into `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/settings.json`
4. Set up slash commands, agents, skills, and hooks

After initialization:
1. Customize `.claude/commands.md` with your project's build/test commands
2. Ensure GitHub CLI is authenticated: `gh auth status`
3. Start Claude Code: `claude`

### CLI Commands

```bash
npx automatasaurus init      # Install into current project
npx automatasaurus update    # Update framework files to latest
npx automatasaurus status    # Show installation info
```

## Usage

### Slash Commands

The primary way to invoke workflows:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/discovery [feature]` | Start discovery to understand requirements and create plan |
| `/work-plan` | Analyze open issues, create sequenced implementation plan |
| `/work-all` | Work through all open issues autonomously |
| `/work [issue#]` | Work on a specific issue |

### `/discovery` - Discovery Mode

```
/discovery user authentication system
```

The discovery command will:
- Lead a conversation about goals, constraints, and requirements
- Bring in specialists (Architect, Designer) for review
- Create well-formed GitHub issues with acceptance criteria
- Organize issues into milestones
- Get your approval before any implementation

### `/work-plan` - Implementation Planning

```
/work-plan
```

Before starting autonomous work, run this command to:
- Analyze all open issues and their dependencies
- Create a sequenced implementation plan
- Generate `implementation-plan.md` with work order and rationale
- Identify blockers and risks

This step helps you review and approve the execution order before `/work-all` begins.

### `/work-all` - Autonomous Loop

```
/work-all
```

The orchestrator will:
- List all remaining issues
- Select next issue based on dependencies and priority
- Spawn `/work {n}` as a subagent for context isolation
- Merge successful PRs
- Continue until all issues complete or circuit breaker limits reached

**Circuit Breaker Limits** (configurable in `.claude/settings.json`):
- `maxIssuesPerRun`: 20 - Stop after this many issues
- `maxEscalationsBeforeStop`: 3 - Stop if stuck too many times
- `maxConsecutiveFailures`: 3 - Stop if failing repeatedly

### `/work` - Single Issue

```
/work 42
```

Work on a specific issue - useful for one-off tickets or addressing a particular issue outside the full autonomous loop:
- Checks dependencies are satisfied
- Gets design specs if UI work is involved
- Developer implements and opens PR
- Coordinates reviews (Architect required, Designer if UI)
- Tester verifies
- Stops after that issue is complete (does not auto-merge)

### Invoking Specific Agents

You can also invoke agents directly:

```
Use the architect agent to review the database schema
Use the tester agent to create a test plan for the API
Use the tester agent with playwright to verify the checkout flow
```

## Dependency Tracking

Issues track dependencies in their body:

```markdown
## Dependencies
Depends on #12 (User authentication)
Depends on #15 (Database schema)
```

The PM uses this to determine issue order - an issue is only "ready" when all dependencies are closed.

## State Labels

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ready` | No blocking dependencies, can be worked |
| `in-progress` | Currently being implemented |
| `blocked` | Waiting on dependencies or input |
| `needs-review` | PR open, awaiting reviews |
| `needs-testing` | Reviews complete, awaiting tester |
| `priority:high/medium/low` | Work order priority |

## Escalation Flow

When the Developer gets stuck after 5 attempts:

```
Developer stuck
    ↓
Escalate to Architect
    ↓
Architect analyzes and provides guidance
    ↓
If Architect also stuck → Notify human and wait
```

## Notifications

Agents send desktop notifications when they need your attention:

| Type | Trigger | Sound |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Question** | Agent has a blocking question | Submarine |
| **Approval** | PR or decision needs approval | Submarine |
| **Stuck** | Agent encountered an issue | Basso |
| **Complete** | All work finished | Hero |

## Configuration

### Project Commands

Edit `.claude/commands.md` for your project's commands:

```markdown
## Quick Reference

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Install dependencies | `npm install` |
| Start development server | `npm run dev` |
| Run all tests | `npm test` |
| Run E2E tests | `npx playwright test` |
```

### MCP Servers

The `.mcp.json` file configures Playwright for browser testing:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Circuit Breaker Limits

Customize limits in `.claude/settings.local.json` (your overrides, never touched by updates):

```json
{
  "automatasaurus": {
    "limits": {
      "maxIssuesPerRun": 50
    }
  }
}
```

Default values in `.claude/settings.json`:
- `maxIssuesPerRun`: 20
- `maxEscalationsBeforeStop`: 3
- `maxRetriesPerIssue`: 5
- `maxConsecutiveFailures`: 3

**Note:** Don't edit `settings.json` directly—your changes will be overwritten on update. Use `settings.local.json` for all customizations.

### Notifications

Configure notification behavior via environment variables:

```bash
# Disable sound alerts
export AUTOMATASAURUS_SOUND=false

# Custom log location
export AUTOMATASAURUS_LOG=/path/to/log
```

## Language Skills

The developer agent loads language-specific skills on demand:

| Language | Skill | Covers |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Python | `python-standards` | PEP 8, type hints, pytest, async patterns |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | `javascript-standards` | ESM, React, testing, error handling |
| CSS/SCSS | `css-standards` | BEM, CSS variables, flexbox/grid, accessibility |

## Customization

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create `.claude/agents/<agent-name>/AGENT.md`
2. Define the frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: agent-name
   description: When to use this agent
   tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob
   model: sonnet
   ---
   ```
3. Write a detailed system prompt including:
   - Responsibilities
   - When to use this agent
   - Comment format: `**[Agent Name]** comment text`
4. Update `CLAUDE.md` with the new agent

### Creating Skills

1. Create `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. Add frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: What this skill does and when to use it
   ---
   ```
3. Document the workflow or knowledge
4. Skills are loaded on-demand when relevant
