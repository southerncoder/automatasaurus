# Automatasaurus

An automated software development workflow powered by Claude Code. Uses specialized subagents, stop hooks, and skills to enable extended autonomous development sessions with multiple coordinated personas.

## Overview

Automatasaurus creates a team of AI personas that work together through GitHub issues and PRs to build software. Each persona has specific expertise and responsibilities, and they coordinate their work using established software development practices.

**This repository contains the workflow orchestration framework.** Install it into your project to enable AI-assisted software development with coordinated agents.

## Workflow

The workflow operates in two phases:

### Phase 1: Planning (Interactive)

```
User describes feature/project
    ↓
Product Owner: Gathers requirements, creates user stories
    ↓
Architect: Makes technology decisions, documents in ADRs
    ↓
Product Owner: Creates GitHub issues with:
  - User story and acceptance criteria
  - Dependencies ("Depends on #X")
  - Priority labels
    ↓
User approves issue breakdown
    ↓
User: "Start working on the issues"
```

### Phase 2: Autonomous Loop (PM Coordinated)

```

## Installation

### Future: CLI Tool (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g automatasaurus

# Initialize in your project
cd your-project
automatasaurus init
```

### Current: Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy the `.claude` folder and `.mcp.json` to your project
3. Customize `.claude/commands.md` with your project's commands
4. Ensure GitHub CLI is authenticated: `gh auth status`
5. Start Claude Code:

```bash
claude
```

## Usage

### Planning Session

Start with a high-level request:

```
Let's plan a user authentication system with login, logout, and password reset
```

The Product Owner and Architect will work with you to:
- Gather requirements
- Make architectural decisions
- Create GitHub issues with dependencies
- Get your approval before starting work

### Starting the Autonomous Loop

Once issues are created:

```
Start working on the issues
```

The PM will coordinate the loop until all issues are complete or human input is needed.

### Invoking Specific Agents

```
Use the architect agent to review the database schema
Use the secops agent to audit our dependencies
Use the tester agent to create a test plan for the API
Use the tester agent with playwright to verify the checkout flow
```

## Dependency Tracking

Issues track dependencies in their body:

```markdown
## Dependencies
Depends on #12 (User authentication)
Depends on #15 (Database schema)
```

The PM uses this to determine issue order - an issue is only "ready" when all dependencies are closed.

## State Labels

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ready` | No blocking dependencies, can be worked |
| `in-progress` | Currently being implemented |
| `blocked` | Waiting on dependencies or input |
| `needs-review` | PR open, awaiting reviews |
| `needs-testing` | Reviews complete, awaiting tester |
| `priority:high/medium/low` | Work order priority |

## Escalation Flow

When the Developer gets stuck after 5 attempts:

```
Developer stuck
    ↓
Escalate to Architect
    ↓
Architect analyzes and provides guidance
    ↓
If Architect also stuck → Notify human and wait
```

## Notifications

Agents send desktop notifications when they need your attention:

| Type | Trigger | Sound |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Question** | Agent has a blocking question | Submarine |
| **Approval** | PR or decision needs approval | Submarine |
| **Stuck** | Agent encountered an issue | Basso |
| **Complete** | All work finished | Hero |

## Configuration

### Project Commands

Edit `.claude/commands.md` for your project's commands:

```markdown
## Quick Reference

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Install dependencies | `npm install` |
| Start development server | `npm run dev` |
| Run all tests | `npm test` |
| Run E2E tests | `npx playwright test` |
```

### MCP Servers

The `.mcp.json` file configures Playwright for browser testing:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Notifications

Configure notification behavior via environment variables:

```bash
# Disable sound alerts
export AUTOMATASAURUS_SOUND=false

# Custom log location
export AUTOMATASAURUS_LOG=/path/to/log
```

## Language Skills

The developer agent loads language-specific skills on demand:

| Language | Skill | Covers |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Python | `python-standards` | PEP 8, type hints, pytest, async patterns |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | `javascript-standards` | ESM, React, testing, error handling |
| CSS/SCSS | `css-standards` | BEM, CSS variables, flexbox/grid, accessibility |

## Customization

### Adding a New Persona

1. Create `.claude/agents/<persona-name>/AGENT.md`
2. Define the frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: persona-name
   description: When to use this agent
   tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob
   model: sonnet
   ---
   ```
3. Write a detailed system prompt including:
   - Responsibilities
   - When to use this agent
   - Comment format: `**[Agent Name]** comment text`
4. Update `CLAUDE.md` with the new persona

### Creating Skills

1. Create `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. Add frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: What this skill does and when to use it
   ---
   ```
3. Document the workflow or knowledge
4. Skills are loaded on-demand when relevant
