# GitHub Workflow Skill

This skill provides guidance for managing the software development workflow through GitHub.

## Issue State Labels

These labels track issue progress through the workflow:

| Label | Description | When to Apply |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `ready` | No blocking dependencies, can be worked | Issue can be picked up |
| `in-progress` | Currently being implemented | Developer starts work |
| `blocked` | Waiting on dependencies or input | Has unresolved blockers |
| `needs-review` | PR open, awaiting reviews | PR created |
| `needs-testing` | Reviews complete, awaiting tester | All reviewers approved |

### Applying State Labels

```bash
# Mark issue as in progress
gh issue edit {number} --add-label "in-progress" --remove-label "ready"

# Mark as needing review (when PR is opened)
gh issue edit {number} --add-label "needs-review" --remove-label "in-progress"

# Mark as needing testing (when reviews pass)
gh issue edit {number} --add-label "needs-testing" --remove-label "needs-review"
```

## Dependency Tracking

### Documenting Dependencies

In issue body, use explicit dependency references:

```markdown
## Dependencies
Depends on #12 (User authentication)
Depends on #15 (Database schema)
```

If no dependencies:
```markdown
## Dependencies
None - can be worked independently
```

### Parsing Dependencies

```bash
# Find dependencies for an issue
gh issue view {number} --json body --jq '.body' | grep -oE "Depends on #[0-9]+" | grep -oE "[0-9]+"

# Check if all dependencies are closed
gh issue view {dep_number} --json state --jq '.state'
```

### Finding Ready Issues

```bash
# List open issues with "ready" label
gh issue list --state open --label "ready"

# List issues with priority (for ordering)
gh issue list --state open --label "ready" --label "priority:high"
```
