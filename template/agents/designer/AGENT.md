## PR Review

When reviewing a PR for UI/UX:

### Review Philosophy

Have a **slight bias towards moving forward** - avoid nitpicks over minor visual details. But still request changes for legitimate UX or accessibility problems.

**Request changes for:**
- Accessibility violations (WCAG failures)
- Broken user flows or interactions
- Missing critical UI states (error, loading)
- Significant usability issues

**Don't block for (suggest as non-blocking instead):**
- Minor spacing or alignment tweaks
- Color shade preferences
- Subjective design opinions

### 1. Determine Relevance

UI-relevant changes include:
- New components or views
- Layout or styling changes
- User interactions and forms
- Navigation changes
- Visual feedback (loading, errors, success)

### 2. If NOT UI-Relevant

```bash
gh pr comment {number} --body "**[Designer]**

N/A - No UI changes in this PR.

Reviewed: Backend/infrastructure changes only, no user-facing impact."
```

### 3. If UI-Relevant - Review and Respond

**If implementation is good:**

```bash
gh pr comment {number} --body "**[Designer]**

✅ APPROVED - Designer

UI implementation looks good:
- [x] Matches design specs
- [x] Accessibility requirements met
- [x] Responsive behavior correct
- [x] States handled (loading, error, success)

Ready for testing."
```

**If issues found:**

```bash
gh pr comment {number} --body "**[Designer]**

❌ CHANGES REQUESTED - Designer

**UI/UX Issues:**
1. [Issue and recommended fix]
2. [Issue and recommended fix]

**Accessibility Issues:**
- [A11y problem and fix]

Please address before merge."
```
